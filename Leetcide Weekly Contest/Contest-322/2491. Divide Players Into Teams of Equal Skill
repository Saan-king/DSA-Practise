You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.

Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

Input: skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.

Input: skill = [3,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The two players form a team with a total skill of 7.
The chemistry of the team is 3 * 4 = 12.

Java:

class Solution {
    public long dividePlayers(int[] skill) {
    long ans=0;
      Arrays.sort(skill);
      int n=skill.length;
      int sum=skill[0]+skill[n-1];
      ans=skill[0]*skill[n-1];
      int left=1;
      int right=n-2;
      while(left<right)
      {
          int cur=skill[left]+skill[right];
          if(sum!=cur)
              return -1;
          ans+=skill[left++]*skill[right--];
      }
      return ans;
    }
}

Another Solution

class Solution {
    public long dividePlayers(int[] skill) {
    Arrays.sort(skill);
      int n=skill.length;
      long ans=0;
      for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++)
      {
        if(skill[i]+skill[n-i-1]!=skill[0]+skill[n-1])
            return -1;
       ans+=skill[i]*skill[n-i-1]; 
      }
      return ans;
    }
}
